* Administrative matters

- course materials [[https://github.com/ionescu/Machine_Learning_2019][on GitHub]]
  - lectures notes will generally be available after the lecture, though drafts may appear before
  - exercises will also be posted on GitHub

- register for CATS points
  - assessment: homework to be handed in a the next meeting (or sent to me by email, or to PPWeekly)
  - every piece of homework is pass or fail

- course takes place Saturdays 10:00-12:30 at Ewert House
  - exceptions: *no class* on the 4th of May and 1st of June!

- main text: /Machine Learning/, Tom Mitchell, 1997
  - there are a couple of copies available in the ContEd library
  - you can buy it used for under 15 GBP on [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/1259096955/ref=sr_1_3_olp?keywords=mitchell+machine+learning&qid=1555784813&s=gateway&sr=8-3][Amazon]]
  - but you should be able to complete the course using only the lecture notes

* Introduction

- types of learning:
  - by rote
  - conditioning
  - from experience
  - any others?

- reasons for /machine learning/:
  - programming is hard, it would be better if computers learnt by themselves
  - to study human learning (and intelligence)
    - perhaps we could then improve our own abilities to learn and to teach

- *Definition* (Mitchell, p. 2) A computer program is said to *learn*
  from experience /E/ with respect to some class of tasks /T/ and
  performance measure /P/, if its performance at tasks in /T/, as
  measured by /P/, improves with experience /E/.
